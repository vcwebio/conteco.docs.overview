# The Ecosystems

The term ecosystem to express a layer of interaction, with one layer providing a foundation for the next layer to build on without being part of that interaction.  

ContEco provides structure for ModEco, and ModEco provides functionality for SwarEco and SolEco.  
InfoMetis closes the circle, by using solutions from SolEco running on clusters from SwarEco to create / manage structure and functionality in ContEco and ModEco respectively.

## ContEco Ecosystem

The ContEco ecosystem ingests images into the platform and then configures them for interaction be it as singletons or as part of a set.

## ModEco Ecosystem

The ModEco ecosystem configures the applications contained within the ContEco to fulfill specific functional needs.  
These functional modules consist of a number of packages. It uses a library of base templates to clone from.

## SwarEco Ecosystem

The SwarEco ecosystem is concerned with clusters of nodes: the creation and management the clusters and the services and containers running on it.

## SolEco Ecosystem

The SolEco ecosystem deals with solutions constructed from functional modules running on SwarEco clusters.

## InfoMetis

InfoMetis brings all layers together into a platform.
